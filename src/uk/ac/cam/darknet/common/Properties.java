 * This class stores a set of key-value pairs. Keys are always strings, but
 * values can be of any appropriate type. It is used for multiple purposes in
 * the system. Each individual possesses an object of this type to store its
 * attributes. Data collectors must provide a list of attributes which they
 * support. Each one of those attribute has a name and a
 * <code>GlobalAttributeType</code>. Thus, the list can be encoded as a
 * properties object in which each key is a string and each value has type
 * <code>GlobalAttributeType</code>.
