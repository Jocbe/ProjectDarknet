    -- a note on terminology: let's refer to the different 'data items,' or kinds of fruit in Josh's
       terminology, as 'attributes' from now on (in the code as well). This should keep confusion to
       a minimum (hopefully). Also, the different categories of attributes should be called, well,
       attribute categories. I have tried to be consistent with the terminology. (Ibby)
    create our own tuple (String : Object)


DBManager *
    store(List<Individual>)
    store(Individual)


DataCollector implements Runnable
    run()
    setup(List<Individual>)
    setup(Individual)


DataCollectionManager
    1. Creates global type table
    2. Creates DatabaseManager, takes global type table as a parameter
    3. Calls Data Collectors (primary, then secondary), they take DBManager as a parameter
