 * have. The preferences can express something like "prefer individuals with a photo" or
 * "prefer individuals with both Facebook and Twitter account information."
 * 
 * When multiple individuals satisfy an effect's strict requirements, the individual who is more
 * preferable is according to the preferences given will be selected.
