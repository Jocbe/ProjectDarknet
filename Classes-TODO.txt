Individual

    other attributes that we obtain from PrimaryDC
    -- a note on terminology: let's refer to the different 'data items,' or kinds of fruit in Josh's
       terminology, as 'attributes' from now on (in the code as well). This should keep confusion to
       a minimum (hopefully). Also, the different categories of attributes should be called, well,
       attribute categories. I have tried to be consistent with the terminology. (Ibby)
    create our own tuple (String : Object) -- done.
    update()? (how does the information a secondarydatacollector stores get merged? because we only have a
        store(Individual) method not Properties. or do updates to an Individual object automatically get stored somehow?) (Farah)


DBManager *
    store(List<Individual>)
    store(Individual)
    getNextIndividualId() - return a unique id so Primary Data Collector can use it to make individual (Farah)
    (Resolved by a static method to Individual which returns a suitable individual to use.
    


DataCollector implements Runnable -- done
    run()
    setup(List<Individual>)
    setup(Individual)
    
ManualDataColletor - needs csv file as input. where will it be passed from? DataCollection


DataCollectionManager
    1. Creates global type table
    2. Creates DatabaseManager, takes global type table as a parameter
    3. Calls Data Collectors (primary, then secondary), they take DBManager as a parameter
